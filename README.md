   - Each segment is designed to house a servo motor for rotation and bending.

3. **Connectors**:
   - Rectangular brackets to connect leg segments.
   
4. **Servo Motors**:
   - Servo motors are embedded within each leg segment.
   - Model: MG996R
   
5. **Top Plate**:
   - Oval plate to cap the leg structure
